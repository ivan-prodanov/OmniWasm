# OmniWasm
Sample WASM.SDK package that wraps OmniSharp in WASM

Consists of two forks:
1. net folder is a fork of https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn
2. js folder is a very old fork of https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp

Both are reworked to utilize direct WASM.SDK instead of HTTP/LSP communication.
